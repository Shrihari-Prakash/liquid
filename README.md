4. Create the following client record in the `clients` colelction:

```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "633972976aaa0ba6952f86db"
  },
  "id": "application_client",
  "grants": [
    "client_credentials",
    "authorization_code",
    "refresh_token"
  ],
  "redirectUris": [
    "your_frontend_uri"
  ],
  "secret": "your_secret"
}
```

5. Start the server using command `npm run start:dev`. Your service should be running on https://localhost:3000.

### User Sign Up:

1. To create an account, visit `/signup` and fill the details.
